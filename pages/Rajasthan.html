        <p>Rajasthan is famous for its special entertainment communities whose profession is to entertain people with their dance and music performances depicting stories of romance and chivalry. <b> Folk dance </b> People of specific communities or castes practise these dance forms and are given credit for conserving them as an art form for ages. A perfect example of this category of folk dance is the kalbeliya dance performed by the people of the snake charmer community. <b> Dhole Dance </b> It is mainly performed in the Jalore region of Rajasthan.This famous folk dance is performed in the Thaakna style. It is generally performed by men of Dholi, Maali, Sarada, and BhilJai Narayan Vyas, a well-known veteran, promoted it. The dhol is the major instrument used during the performance. </p>
