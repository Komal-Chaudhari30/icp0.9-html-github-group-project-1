    <h2><u> Mharashtra Attire:-</u></h2>
    <p><b>The traditional attire of Maharashtra required the men to wear a dhoti, kurta or a cotton shirt, pheta (headwear or topi) and waistcoat or bandi which was optional.
       Women wear choli or blouse on the top and a 9-yard long saree called 'lugade' or 'nauwari saadi'. They usually wore open sandals or chappals as their footwear. In the 21st century, most of the people have started wearing western clothes or a fusion of Indian and western wear. The traditional attire is worn by very few but is worn by many during any religious event or Marathi festival. </b></p>
        <h2><u> Maharashtra Food:-</u></h2>
